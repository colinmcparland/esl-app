# ESL Programming Challenge

Please note CORS should be disabled for this widget to work properly.
Deployed with `Docker` at https://esl.tinybird.ca

## Functionality
This widget takes in a tournament ID via a URL pattern.  For example, to see data for tournament ID 177160, navigate to esl.tinybird.ca/177160.  Note the app defaults to tournament ID 177160 if given no URL pattern.

## Main packages used
Bootstrapped with `create-react-app`, styles done with `styled-components`, `axios` for network requests and `react-redux` for state management.  `react-redux` wasn't really necessary for the scope of this widget, I just wanted to show my understanding of it.
